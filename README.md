# EV3 IoTcraft

A simple example of how to connect the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 brick to an MQTT server.

Requires adding the EV3DEV image to the brick using a microSD card as described in the [Getting Started with ev3dev](https://www.ev3dev.org/docs/getting-started/) guide.

We recommend you use the [LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 MicroPython](vscode:extension/lego-education.ev3-micropython) extension for Visual Studio Code.
